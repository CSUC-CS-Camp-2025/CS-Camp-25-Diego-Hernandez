    <p class="simple">Hello, my name is Diego Hernandez. I'm seventeen years old, I just recently graduated from high school and I plan on attending Chico State with a major in mechanical engineering. I have plans for myself that involve hard work, perserverance, and determination.</p>
    <ul class="simple" class="borderclass">
      Hobbies:
        <li>Volleyball: I started playing four years ago at the start of high school. I was only able to get on the varsity team for my senior year.</li>
        <li>Video games: I do not have a console or a pc, only my phone. I usually only play Brawl Stars, Clash of Clans(COC), and others.</li>
        <li>Reading: I was very into reading during middle school and I'm just now getting back into it as a way to pass time. On the second day of camp, Leo and I went to a bookstore close by the campus and I got "The Silver Kiss" by Annette Curtis Klause and it's a really enjoyable read that really builds off of the main characters relationships.</li>
        <li>Music: I like listening to music, it helps me very much when I'm going through my day and I also always thought that there's a difference between having music taste and having a taste for music.</li>
    </ul>
